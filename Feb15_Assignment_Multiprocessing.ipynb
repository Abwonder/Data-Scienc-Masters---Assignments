    "Q1. What is multiprocessing in python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to support more than one processor at the same time. Applications in a multiprocessing system are broken to smaller routines that run independently. it connote running operation in parallel and most useful for operation that require more processing computational power.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary advantage of a multiprocessor computer is speed, and thus the ability to manage larger amounts of information, it is useful for running operation that require high computational power where task can be delegated to different processor and they run independent of one another. Its improve the speed of running programs."

    "1. In Multiprocessing, Many processes are executed simultaneously while in multithreading, many threads of a process are executed simultaneously.\n",
    "2. Multiprocessing are classified into Symmetric and Asymmetric while Multithreading is not classified in any categories.\n",
    "3. In Multiprocessing, Process creation is a time-consuming process while in Multithreading, process creation is according to economical.\n",
    "4. In Multiprocessing, every process owned a separate address space while in Multithreading, a common address space is shared by all the threads.\n",
    "5. \tIn Multiprocessing, CPUs are added for increasing computing power while In Multithreading, many threads are created of a single process for increasing computing power."
